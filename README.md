## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. You will find clear and well-commented C code examples for a wide range of data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

- Array creation, manipulation, and common operations.

### Linked Lists

- Implementation of singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.
- Operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Stacks

- Implementation of a stack data structure.
- Stack operations (push, pop, peek) and common use cases.

### Queues

- Implementation of queues using arrays or linked lists.
- Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue) and applications.

### Trees

- Binary trees and binary search trees (BST).
- Tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- AVL trees and balancing.

### Graphs

- Graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list).
- Graph traversal algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search).
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford).

### Hash Tables

- Hash table implementation for efficient key-value storage.
- Hashing functions and collision resolution strategies.

### Heaps

- Binary heaps (min-heap, max-heap) and priority queues.
- Heap operations (insertion, extraction, heapify).

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort.
- Merge sort, quicksort, and other efficient sorting techniques.

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear search and binary search.
- Searching in sorted and unsorted data.

### Dynamic Programming

- Examples of dynamic programming problems and solutions.
- Memoization and tabulation approaches.

### Greedy Algorithms

- Illustrations of greedy algorithm approaches to solving problems.
- Huffman coding, activity selection, and more.

### Graph Algorithms

- Minimum spanning tree algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's).
- Network flow algorithms (Ford-Fulkerson).
- Topological sorting and more.
